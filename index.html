<h1>Archive Utilities for Eclipse</h1>
<p>
  The Archive Utilities extend the Eclipse IDE to view the structure and content and extract 
  zip archive files within the workspace. Zip-compatible archives like JARs, WARs, etc. are of
  course also supported.

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
  Files with zip content can be extracted entirely or partially to locations in the workspace or 
  file system.
</p>  
<p>
  In the 
  <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Freference%2Fref-27.htm">
    Project Explorer</a>, 
  zip files can be expanded just like folders to reveal their 
  content. The content of each file within the archive can be viewed in an editor.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
  Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) or newer.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
  Install from this Eclipse software repository: 
  <span class="link">http://rherrmann.github.com/com.codeaffine.archive/repository</span>
</p>
<p>
  From the Eclipse main menu, choose <em>Help -> Install New Software...</em> In the upcoming 
  dialog, enter the above URL in the <em>Work with</em> field.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
  For files with zip content, an <em>Extract...</em> action is added to all places that work 
  with resources. The <em>Package Explorer</em> for example shows an <em>Extract...</em> menu 
  item if the file is an archive.
</p>
<p>
  In the <em>Project Explorer</em> view, zip files can be expanded just like folders to reveal 
  their content. Each file within the archive can be viewed in an editor. Right-click the file 
  to show and choose <em>Open</em>.
</p>
<p>
  To extract items from the archive, select the items to be extracted and choose 
  <em>Extract...</em> from the context menu. The upcoming dialog asks for a destination location.
</p>

<h2>Known Issues and Future Ideas</h2>
<p>
  As the version number 0.1 suggests, there are still some open ends...
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enable for use with Eclipse 3.6</li>
  <li>Key bindings for <em>Open</em> and <em>Extract</em></li>
  <li><em>Open with...</em> action</li>
  <li>Nested archive files</li>
  <li>Fix DnD to the editor area. It fails non-deterministic (needs investigation).</li>
  <li>Support other archive/compression formats (tar.gz, what else?)</li>
  <li>Expanding an archive in the _Project Explorer_ is currently done on the UI thread. This 
    may lead to UI freezes when expanding very large archive on a slow machine.</li>
</ul>
